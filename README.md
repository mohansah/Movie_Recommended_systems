# Movie_Recommended_systems

Under this, I have gone through the details of MovieLens dataset and correlation concept and successfully build a popularity, user and item based movie recommended system. I used python programming language & jupyter notebook software for the implementation.

# What is recommendation system ?
A recommendation system filters the data using different algorithms and recommends the most relevant items to users. It first captures the past behavior of a customer and based on that, recommends products which the users might be likely to buy. 

# MovieLens Dataset
This data has been collected by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota.
This dataset consists of:
1. 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies.
2. Each user has rated at least 20 movies.
3. Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)
4. Genre information of movies
